# Blog Space

- This application is a practice project for my API and URLs muscles üí™
- In this app, people can add new blogs on the site
- The blogs already displayed on the page are pulled from external server
- Got a chance to explore the syntax of fetch in JavaScript

- Also, learnt about the Request-Response cycle
